# free_fall_analysis

This project simulates the motion of a free-falling object under Earth's gravity, neglecting air resistance.

The objective is to simulate vertical free fall using classical physics equations and to visualize the position and velocity over time. Additionally, the project estimates the gravitational constant *g* using linear regression on the simulated data. 

The analysis is performed using Python3, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and SciPy.
