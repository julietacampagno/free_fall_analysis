Free Fall Simulation and Gravitational Acceleration Estimation

This project simulates the motion of a point particule in vertical free fall under Earth's gravity, assuming no air resistance. The goal is to simulate vertical free fall using classical physics equations, visualize position and velocity as functions of time and to estimate the gravitational acceleration *g* using linear and cuadratic regression on the simulated data.

The analysis is done using Python 3, with the help of the following libraries: NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization and SciPy for regression and scientific tools.
